TextMate Bundle for Java Velocity Syntax
====

It's not an exhaustive implementation, but it's at least good enough to bother using ;)

If you notice any issues please be sure to report them!

I don't actually use Velocity anymore personally so I'm not implementing any new features.
I do try to fix any major bugs that people find from time to time.

If you're interested in taking over maintainance, do let me know.

Thanks!
